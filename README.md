Implements the MLE, Naive Bayes and KNN classifiers from scratch in Python 3


mle.py has the MLE classifier
knn.py has the nearest neighbour classifier
naive.py has the Naive Bayes classifier
plotting.py has the code to plot the three DP, EO, PP plots. It takes values from all three files. The code was originally run on a Jupyter notebook. 

A neural net is implemented using Stochastic Gradient Descent and Adam's optimiser from scratch in Python 3
